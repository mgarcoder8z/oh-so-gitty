These are code exercises incorporating different jQuery, Python, and Javascript functions and libraries for demonstration purposes. They also use HTML5 and CSS2 and CSS3. The Periodic Chart is an example of several JQuery functions and commands in one file to demonstrate the different capabilities of JQuery in a fun way. The Bunny Man Game does not have collision detection in place, but shows how I used javascript, HTML5 and CSS to create the game.

These are code exercises incorporating different jQuery, Python, C, and Javascript code, functions and libraries for demonstration purposes. Some also use HTML5 and CSS2, CSS3 and frameworks such as Materialize or Bootstrap. The Periodic Chart is an example of several JQuery functions and commands in one file to demonstrate the different capabilities of JQuery in a fun way. The original assignment was to make a list of jQuery scripts but I used 16 of them in one file to make the periodic table interactive. The Bunny Man Game and 1942 do not have collision detection in place, but demonstrate how I used javascript, HTML5 and CSS to create the simple games.
